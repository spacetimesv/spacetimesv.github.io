## We have no idea
A guide to the unknown universe
Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson

What we know about universe is just 5% and there so much we don’t know. This super interesting and extremely well written and witty book talks about how far we have come to get a sense of what we know and how much we don’t know and the big question - why.

They take us in a journey explaining the concepts in a funny way and at the same time giving the structure and model of how the universe is built - on both scales sub-atomic to the boundaries and the expansion of universe. So much so that even llamas, cats, hamsters and ofcourse baboons play a big role in explaining us how much we don’t know. The authors definitely wrote a few pages from coffee shops and have big giant pool on their backyard not maintained so well:)

Every chapter starts with a witty question and ends with a followup and further deeper question that keep you going. You just enjoy this ride as a reader and makes us feel good about how much we don’t know in a way.

The space, time, the dark matter and the dark energies and the sub-atomic particles that makeup everything - the bonding and the universal limit for speed limit and above all telling us that there was only one event in the past that has gone above the speed of light.

And then there are some notations on the language of universe told to us in gentle story form and doesn’t scare us at all. There are chapters that talk about dimensions and again the writing brilliance takes us on various planes of our own thinking without getting us tripped over our seats. And after a point we feel like - bring on anything we are here to travel together. An example is our own reasoning about time - An increasing order from lower entropy to higher.

They take us home in the final chapters on various deeper questions about Big Bang and what could have happened before big-bang and what started it. There is one funny idea about Big Bang, crunch and repeat cycle.

The concept of multi-universe is brought in and some references to simulation ideas followed by the “Are we alone”.  The theory of everything gives us much relief as to why it is perfectly ok to be on a level of abstraction and sometimes no need to dig into everything. Then comes the not to be seen black holes but they don’t stop there - the mother of all black holes the super black hole.

There is a sign in the book that says - deep thinking ahead - the purpose of this creation and how it could well be a simulation or in our minds and how several beliefs have taken up on that subject.
