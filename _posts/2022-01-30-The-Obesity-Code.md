# The Obesity code
## Jason Fung

Happened to read one of the most influential book (not that I have put to practice yet) but wanted to share some key insights/ most of these are very well known but thought worth sharing anyways. Please do read the book for a complete full take on the subject.
  - very good analysis of what causes weight gain and how does things work
  - Root cause points to hormonal imbalance
  - To be more precise - insulin and even more specifically insulin resistance
  - The mechanics - insulin acts as a key to unlock pathway for glucose to cells. But excess insulin in blood causes our body cells to go on insulin resistance and thereby causing a vicious cycle causing even more eating to maintain the body set weight.
  - We all know everything we eat secretes insulin but there is a bio thermostat that maintains the body set weight and when this balance going off track it causes weight gain.
  - Author does a great job analyzing various studies, data and breaks down why so many popular diets do not work and often show result initially but then eventually plateaus and causes a surprising rebound and regaining of weight 
    
So what is missing - the central point of the book is about the insulin sensitivity of the body and how can one maintain it.

What we eat - we all know this very well but just to state it again
  - avoid added sugars
  - avoid processed foods
  - avoid anything refined

When we eat
Here is where the author takes on the final lap to put a closure to the framework. The window of time that we finish all our meals in a day. This establishes a good insulin surplus to a insulin low time period there by giving enough time for the body to get that balance and helps lower insulin resistance.

The author is a big proponent of intermittent fasting and I’m sure many here are used to it in some form. The window of eating and fasting within a day can be adjusted based on our body needs. E.g 12-12 which means finish all of your eating in a day within a 12 hour window and rest of the 12 hours just water (green tea or coffee with no sugar) and no eating. Other sliding windows could be 10-14 or 8-16.

It is not just about what we eat but also about the timing. I liked the way the book is written and easy to read (not sure about the putting to practice part yet:))

The book is “The Obesity Code” by Jason Fung
